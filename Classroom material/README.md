# JULY 8

Hello everyone and welcome to this course. This week, we're gonna be focussing on Cryptography with python. To start things off, you are gonna be needing a Python environment.
there are two ways to go about it: 
1)install python on your system - https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-install-python
2)use online notebooks like google colab


Now moving forward with this week's material:
If you're completely new to cryptography, I would suggest going through these links first-
https://www.edureka.co/blog/what-is-cryptography/
and then go through the pages in this link to get familiar with different terms used in cryptography.
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography/index.htm 


Don't worry if you don't understand something on the first try, there are enough resources on the internet to keep you going and also keep posting your doubts on classroom or in the Whatsapp group. We are all here to help you out.
Try to complete the material by Saturday and of course, take care and have great learning ahead!

Now, onwards with implementation of cryptographic techniques with python, go through pages in this link one by one:
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography_with_python/index.htm
Most of the code is pretty intuitive but if you have any doubts, do post it on the group.
Try to complete it by Thursday.

Hey guys, So this week we will be learning about Sockets and Web Scraping.

You will be utilizing the first half of this week for learning Socket Programming in Python or Python-nmap module and using it to build a Port Scanner.

An excellent tutorial for Socket Programming can be found here https://yasoob.me/2013/08/06/python-socket-network-programming/.

You can read through this medium article - https://medium.com/manishmshiva/nmap-a-guide-to-the-greatest-scanning-tool-of-all-time-3bd1a973a5e5 , to learn about Nmap and how to use it. Then you can then use the python-nmap module linked here - https://pypi.org/project/python-nmap/  to create your own custom Port Scanner based on Nmap.


You can use either Socket Programming or the python-nmap module to create the port scanner.

Hey Guys,

So for the next half of this week, you'll be learning about Python's requests and BeautifulSoup library for web scraping. 
Attached below are some tutorial videos to get you started.

I am expecting everyone of you to have gone through these videos by 23rd of July.




# JULY 24


Hey Guys,

You will be utilizing the rest of this week to learn about Web Crawlers, Web Scraping with Scrapy and how to store the scraped data in a database.
Traversy Media's video linked here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALizgnSFTwQ , provides an excellent tutorial to the topic.
You can follow this tutorial here: https://realpython.com/web-scraping-with-scrapy-and-mongodb/ , which will teach you about how to store scraped data in your db. You can setup a local MongoDB database or use their MongoDB Atlas Cloud Database (https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) to setup a free database hosted in the cloud.

Hey everyone!
Hopefully everyone's done with web crawling, this time you'll be learning about OWASP top 10.
(https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).
We won't be covering all of them as some of them are self explanatory. We'll be starting with #1 vulnerability i.e Injection.

SQL, NOSQL and LDAP injection have been considered as one of the most notorious vulnerabilities out there and some websites still have them. Here's something to get you started with.

SQL Basics for Beginners (edureka!):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbMHLJ0dY4w

You can go through it 1.5x or 2x, just try to get an understanding of how SQL works.

To help you get a better understanding of sql injection:

Running an SQL Injection Attack (Computerphile):

A few sqli challenges:

Try doing the first 2 labs from https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection without using burpsuite .
You can also read through the material there for a better understanding.


Also, instead of manually entering the payload through the browser try to use python and send the payload (for the 1st two labs from portswigger)
